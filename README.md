# End-to-End Data Engineering Project on Azure  

This project demonstrates a complete data engineering pipeline built using Microsoft Azure services. The pipeline processes the AdventureWorks dataset, showcasing efficient data ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization.  

## üöÄ Project Overview  
The pipeline follows a multi-layer architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) for organizing and processing data:  
1. **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion using Azure Data Factory (ADF).  
2. **Silver Layer**: Data transformation with Azure Databricks and PySpark.  
3. **Gold Layer**: Aggregated and structured data stored as tables using Azure Synapse Analytics.  
4. **Visualization**: Insights presented through interactive Power BI dashboards.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Fetched data from the AdventureWorks dataset hosted on GitHub and loaded it into the Bronze layer of Azure Data Lake.  
- **Azure Databricks & PySpark**: Processed and transformed data, storing the results in the Silver layer.  
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Further transformed data and saved it as tables in the Gold layer of the data lake.  
- **Azure Data Lake Storage**: Served as the centralized storage repository for all data layers.  
- **Power BI**: Created dashboards to visualize key insights and trends.  

## üåü Key Highlights  
- Built a **multi-layer data lake architecture** for raw, processed, and aggregated data.  
- Designed **efficient workflows** for seamless data ingestion and transformation.  
- Implemented **secure access management** using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Managed Identities.  
- Enhanced performance with **Delta Tables** and optimized transformation logic.  

## üß† Key Learnings  
- Developed expertise in handling large-scale data transformations using PySpark.  
- Streamlined incremental data loading with Databricks **Auto Loader**.  
- Optimized workflows for orchestrating complex data pipeline tasks.  
- Designed user-friendly and visually engaging dashboards in Power BI.  

## üìà Project Outcome  
This project delivers a scalable and secure end-to-end data pipeline that showcases advanced data engineering practices. The insights derived through Power BI offer actionable data-driven decision-making capabilities.
