# Adventure-work-Azure-Data-Engineering-Project
End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline on Azure

ðŸš€ Project Overview
Designed and implemented a scalable, end-to-end data engineering pipeline using Microsoft Azure services. This project processes the AdventureWorks dataset, ensuring efficient data ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization through a structured multi-layer architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).

ðŸ”¹ Bronze Layer: Ingested raw data using Azure Data Factory (ADF) and stored it in Azure Data Lake Storage.
ðŸ”¹ Silver Layer: Transformed data with Azure Databricks and PySpark, improving data quality and structure.
ðŸ”¹ Gold Layer: Aggregated and structured data using Azure Synapse Analytics, making it ready for business insights.
ðŸ”¹ Visualization: Built interactive Power BI dashboards to deliver actionable insights.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
âœ” Azure Data Factory (ADF) â€“ Automated data ingestion from GitHub into the Bronze layer.
âœ” Azure Databricks & PySpark â€“ Processed and cleaned data for Silver-layer storage.
âœ” Azure Synapse Analytics â€“ Optimized data storage and structured it for analytical queries.
âœ” Azure Data Lake Storage â€“ Centralized storage for all layers of data.
âœ” Power BI â€“ Developed dashboards to visualize key trends and insights.
